
1)Add the remote, call it "upstream":
git remote add upstream <link> (for example https://github.com/cursor-education/welcome-to-github)

2)Fetch all the branches of that remote into remote-tracking branches,such as upstream/master:
git fetch upstream

3)Make sure that you're on your master branch:
git checkout master

4)Rewrite your master branch so that any commits of yours that aren't already in upstream/master are replayed on top of that
other branch:
git rebase upstream/master
OR
Merge our upstream with master 
git merge upstream/master
